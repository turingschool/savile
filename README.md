# Savile - Turing's Design System

The Turing School of Software and Design's Design System. The site provides an everything-in-one-place guide to our style guide and available utils and class names for pre-built components that conform to the style guide. The design system itself is consumed by all* sites and apps in the Turing suite via CDN.

## Savile Guiding Principles

While we have Guiding Principles for our overarching work on the Turing Engineering Team, we wanted to get more granular with areas of priority and commitment to Savile. The Guiding Principles listed below should guide decisions we make about the project and help users understand the purpose of it.

- **Accessible.** This is well-documented and easy-to-use for all staff members. Users know of all the utils, elements, and components and the variants of those that are available to them. They are able to quickly reference documentation to know what the the rendered version will look like and be able to quickly access the code needed.
- **Simple.** This is a lightweight package in term of size. It is conceptually simple and straightforward; intuitive naming and reasonable variants. A developer should be able to read through our docs and in a couple hours have a good handle on how it works and how to utilize it.
- **Extensible.** It is built in a way that various team members can build on top of it relatively easily. Ways to override and customize are available and documented.
- **Durable.** The current form will last and continue to work, for all users and all app, regardless of tech stack.
- **Composable.** - Utils and variants can be combined in many ways to create custom designs.
- **Innocuous.** - It plays friendly w other tools like Bootstrap, MaterialUI, etc. and is web platform-agnostic.

## Local Set Up

To set the project up locally on your machine:

- clone the repo down with `git clone git@github.com:turingschool/savile.git`
- fetch the `gh-pages` branch with `git fetch origin gh-pages`
- checkout to `gh-pages` with `git checkout gh-pages`
- run `bundle exec jekyll serve`

## Contributing

Please follow Turing's shared [How to Contribute](https://www.notion.so/turingschool/How-to-Contribute-1b88e17f755c491989e4b2bc84db93c7) guide.

## How To: Add a Token, Element or Component

The workflow to add a token, element or component to Savile is as follows:

- Touch a new `.scss` file in within the appropriate sub-directory of the css directory at the root of the project. The file name should match the name of the token/element/component you are building. Find the dictionary below as well as project naming conventions (coming soon).
- Write the SCSS for your token/element/component
- Above the SCSS code, create a multi-line CSS comment. Provide any relevant information in the comment, using the available attributes (listed below). See the following example for the specific syntax the docs generator expects:
    - `title` - this will be presented on the docs site and will be the name of the CSS file that is generated in the `css_docs` directory.
    - `status` - is this a draft, complete, not-maintained, etc?
    - `description` - short description that the user of Savile will be provided with on the docs site
    - `example` - the HTML you write here will be rendered as the actual element; this provides an example of how this SCSS will style the element.

    ```css
    /*
     * @title Button
     * @status draft
     * @description Our basic button
     *
     * @example
     * <button class="button">
     *   Click me
     * </button>
     */
    ```

- In your terminal, run `ruby build_css_docs.rb` to run the generator, which will take the single SCSS file you created and wrote, and both feed the CSS into the design system (`_site/css`), and take the documentation and make it markdown-friendly (`css_docs`).
- While running the project locally, visit the appropriate URI in the browser. You should see this newly created token/element/component displayed with it's respective information.
